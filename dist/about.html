        <h3>Thing 1: Yarn Crafts</h3>
        <h6>Crochet? Knitting? Spinning yarn? I can do it all.</h6>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSUilh9jQpI/?hl=en&taken-by=jordanoftroy">
          <img class="hobby-img" src="./img/drop-spindle-1.jpg" alt="drop spindle">
        </a>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The person responsible for my love of crocheting, knitting, and all fiber-related crafts
            is my grandmother. She loved to crochet, and was able to make each of her grandchildren 
            an afghan when they were born.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I remember watching her when I was a young child and being entranced by the swift and 
          rhythmic motions of her hands. I would watch her for hours, sitting perfectly still, as 
          she worked on a project for one of my future cousins. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          During my teenage years I decided that it was time to learn the skill that my grandmother so 
          lovingly enjoyed. After a few videos, courtesy of YouTube, I was off and running. 
          My first project, while structurally sound, was a bit of an eye sore. But I loved every moment
          that I spent working on it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Fast forward to today, and that spark of inspiration from my childhood has grown into  roaring fire.
          My skill set and technique have improved tremendously from where they started, although there is always
          room for improvement. The scale and complexity of the projects that I take on have drastically
          increased as well. It has taken years of patience and perseverance, but I have definitely seen a return
           on my investment.

        <h3>Thing 2: Gardening</h3>
        <h6>Like Hobbits, I too have a love for all things that grow.</h6>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/lsLf9NzGm-/?hl=en&taken-by=jordanoftroy">
          <img class="hobby-img" src="./img/plant-1.jpg" alt="aloe vera">
        </a>
        <p class="paragraph">
          When the season is right, and the space is available, there is no place I'd rather be
          than spending time in the garden. Any item that is high on my bucket list is to one day 
          have a garden large enough to stock my pantry with home canned goods. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Not only do I plan on having a garden filled with delicious edible goodness, I also envision
          a home surrounded with the vibrant beauty of flowers and lush vegetation. A particular 
          favorite of mine is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocissus_quinquefolia"><i>P. quinquefolia</i></a>.
          Virginia Creeper is a fast growing vine that has large decorative foliage. In the fall, it
          turns a blazing shade of red.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          My flora fascination doesn't end with the outdoors. My home is adorned with a plethora of 
          leafy friends. A significant portion of my collection is comprised of what I have termed 
          <q>memory plants</q>. Whenever there is a significant event or place in my life, I like to
          take a cutting from nearby and root that cutting. I have ivy from my sisters wedding, a mystery
          vine from my brothers wedding, and a small shrubbery from the bush that grew outside the office 
          of my first job in Utah. And when the time is right, I will plant the lily bulbs that used to
          grow in my great-grandmothers flower beds.

        <h3>Thing 3: Game Night Champion</h3>
        <h6>Be it board, card, or party games.... I will destroy you.</h6>

        </a>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I am an avid lover of all tabletop and party games. If I had a top-10 list, it would
          have to include (in no particular order):
          <ul class="top=ten-list">
            <li class="top-tens">The Tales of Arabian Nights</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Smallworld: Undergorund</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Tsuto of the Seas</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Forbidden Island</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Bananagrams</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Hand & Foot</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Splendor</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Munchkin</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Quarriors</li>
            <li class="top-tens">Bang!</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          My favorite part about playing games is getting to know the people you are playing with.
          While I do enjoy winning, I would much rather have an enjoyable experience while losing
          than a contentious experience while winning.
