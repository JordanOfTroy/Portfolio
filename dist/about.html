        <h3>Thing 1: Yarn Crafts</h3>
        <h6>Crochet? Knitting? Spinning yarn? I can do it all.</h6>

          When it comes to picking members of post-apocalyptic survival team, I'm your man. Not only can I 
          fashion protective garments to shield you from the cold, I can also manufacture my own supplies.
          Lame jokes aside, I do really enjoy unwinding with a crochet hook and a nice skein of yarn. I taught
          myself how to knit and crochet when I was fifteen. And shortly after I began teaching myself how to spin yarn.

          When the season is right, and the space is available, there is no place I'd rather be
          than spending time in the garden. I love spending time with my hands in the soil, working
          to improve and enhance production. I also enjoy taking a piece of nature inside. When winter
          comes, I like to keep my house filled with as much foliage as it can handle.

          I am an avid lover of all tabletop and party games. If I had a top- list, it would
          have to include (in no particular order): Forbidden Island, Bananagrams, Munchkin, Quarriors, and Bang.
          However, there are many more that could be included on that list.
