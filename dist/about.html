        <h3>Thing 1: Yarn Crafts</h3>
        <h6>Crochet? Knitting? Spinning yarn? I can do it all!</h6>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The person responsible for my love of crocheting, knitting, and all fiber-related crafts
            is my grandmother. She loved to crochet, and was able to make each of her grandchildren 
            an afghan when they were born.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I remember watching her when I was a young child and being entranced by the swift and 
          rhythmic motions of her hands. I would watch her for hours, sitting perfectly still, as 
          she worked on a project for one of my future cousins. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          During my teenage years I decided that it was time to learn the skill that my grandmother so 
          lovingly enjoyed. After a few videos, curtesy of Youtube, I was off and running. 
          My first project, while structurally sound, was a but of an eye sore. But I loved every moment
          that I spent working one it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Fast forward to today, and that spark of inspiration from my childhood has grown into  roaring fire.
          my skill set and technique have improved tremendously from where they started, although there is always
          room for improvement. And the scale and complexity of the projects that I take on have drastically
          increased as well. It has taken years of patience and perseverance, but I have definitely seen a return
           on my investment.
